## Introduction

Ocean Global is committed to fostering a decentralized, transparent, and secure environment for blockchain projects. Our smart contracts, built on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), provide essential functionalities such as locking liquidity, conducting presales, managing crowdsales and private sales, and enabling token minting.

## Smart Contracts

The repository includes the following OpenZeppelin-based smart contracts:

- **Locker**: Securely lock liquidity or tokens using a non-custodial smart contract.
- **Presale**: Conduct decentralized presales on popular EVM blockchains, such as Binance Smart Chain and Ethereum.
- **Crowdsale**: Manage and execute decentralized crowdsales, ensuring a fair and transparent fundraising process.
- **Private Sale**: Facilitate private sales with customizable parameters to meet project-specific requirements.
- **Token Minter**: Create custom BEP20 tokens effortlessly using Ocean Global's token minting functionality.

## Why OpenZeppelin

We've chosen to build our smart contracts on the OpenZeppelin framework, a leading library for secure and community-vetted smart contract development. OpenZeppelin provides battle-tested implementations of essential smart contract functionalities, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities and ensuring the security of our platform.
